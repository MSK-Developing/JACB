![GitHub commit activity](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/y/MSK-Developing/JACB?style=for-the-badge)  ![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/MSK-Developing/JACB?style=for-the-badge)

## What is this Garbage?
This Discord bot was created to generate personalized coupons for server users. With this bot, admins will be able to generate, distribute, delete and control coupons for their servers!

## Commands

The bot uses slash command (`/`) for all of its commands.
- `/help`: Shows an help message (will be added in the next Update, so maybe tomorrow)

- `/gen_coupon <discount>`: Generate a new coupon with the specified discount.

- `/list_coupon`: Shows a list of all created coupons

- `/check_coupon <code>`: Analyze a coupon to see if it is fake or is present in the database (practically sees if it exists or not)

- `/delete_coupon <code>`: Delete a specified coupon

- `/use_coupon <code>`: Uses a specified coupon

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to a local machine
2. Create a new Discord bot and get the access token
3. Enter the directory and install the reqs using the `pip install -r req.txt` command
4. Edit the `config.py` file to your liking
5. Start the bot by running the `python main.py` command
